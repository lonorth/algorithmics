# algorithmics

Welcome! This repo is my **DS&A reboot camp**.
It’s a mix of:

- algorithms I already know (but want to make *muscle memory*),
- algorithms I *think* I know (danger zone),
- and algorithms I definitely don’t know (yet).

In my solutions, I plan to stick with **C++**, but might randomly implement stuff in other languages if it feels interesting during the study session.
